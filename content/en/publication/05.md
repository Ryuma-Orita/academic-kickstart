abstract: We present a lower bound for a fragmentation norm and construct a bi-Lipschitz embedding $I\\colon \\mathbb{R}^n\\to\\mathrm{Ham}(M)$ with respect to the fragmentation norm on the group $\\mathrm{Ham}(M)$ of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a symplectic manifold $(M,\\omega)$. As an application, we provide an answer to Brandenbursky's question on fragmentation norms on $\\mathrm{Ham}(\\Sigma_g)$, where $\\Sigma_g$ is a closed Riemannian surface of genus $g\\geq 2$.
