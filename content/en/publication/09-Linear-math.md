abstract = "A textbook of linear algebra for students in the natural sciences. From the user's point of view, the text is carefully explained with many diagrams and examples so that students can understand what they are learning rather than the logical rigor of the subject. In addition, the book has been rewritten to make it easier to understand for students who are learning matrices for the first time while maintaining the features of the previous edition, and to enable students to perform diagonalization of matrices in two lessons. Proofs are given so that the reader can understand the results. (Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version))"
