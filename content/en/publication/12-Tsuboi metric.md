# abstract = "Many transformation groups on manifolds are simple, but their universal coverings are not. In the present paper, we study the concept of relatively simple group, that is, a group with the maximum proper normal subgroup. We show that many examples of universal coverings of transformation groups are relatively simple, including the universal covering $\\widetilde{\\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\\omega)$ of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold $(M,\\omega)$. Tsuboi constructed a metric space $\\mathcal{M}(G)$ for a simple group $G$. We generalize his construction to relatively simple groups, and study their large scale geometric structure. In particular, Tsuboi's metric space of $\\widetilde{\\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\\omega)$ is not quasi-isometric to the half line for every closed symplectic manifold $(M,\\omega)$."
