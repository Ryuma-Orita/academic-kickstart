# abstract = "In this paper, we define Morse--Bott homology on oriented compact smooth Riemannian manifolds by using smooth singular simplicial chains and compactified moduli spaces determined by  Morse-Bott-Smale function. This allows for a simpler definition of Morse-Bott homology and more computable examples."
