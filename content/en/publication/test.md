abstract: "We present a lower bound for a fragmentation norm and construct a bi-Lipschitz embedding $I\colon \mathbb{R}^n\to\Ham(M)$ with respect to the fragmentation norm on the group $\Ham(M)$ of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$. As an application, we provide an answer to Brandenbursky's question on fragmentation norms on $\Ham(\Sigma_g)$, where $\Sigma_g$ is a closed Riemannian surface of genus $g\geq 2$."
