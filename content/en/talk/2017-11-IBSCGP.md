summary: "Seminar"
abstract: "In the talk, we will deal with periodic orbits in Hamiltonian dynamics. Especially, we will show that if a Hamiltonian on a certain class of symplectic manifolds has a non-contractible orbit, then the Hamiltonian must have infinitely many non-contractible orbits. Here we note that if we don't stick to the existence of "non-contractible" orbits, then the Conley conjecture, which is proven for many symplectic manifolds, already implies the existence of infinitely many (not necessarily non-contractible) orbits. The proof uses the Floer homology and the Eilenberg-MacLane spaces."
