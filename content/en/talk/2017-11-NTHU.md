summary: "15th Taiwan Geometry Symposium"
abstract: "The Arnold conjecture indicates that the number of fixed points of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism on a closed symplectic manifold is more than or equal to the total Betti number of the manifold. Today it is known that the conjecture is true for all closed symplectic manifolds. For the proof, a variant of Morse Theory, which is called Floer theory, was introduced. Then the well-known "Morse inequality" shows the conjecture. Actually, Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms tend to have infinitely many fixed points (Conley conjecture). Namely, the Conley conjecture claims that every Hamiltonian function has infinitely many periodic orbits. In the talk, I will introduce some recent results along these lines."
