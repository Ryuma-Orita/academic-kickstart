abstract = "In this paper, we show that the pointwise finite-dimensional two-parameter persistence module $\\mathbb{HF}_{\\ast}^{(\\bullet,\\bullet]}$, defined in terms of interlevel filtered Floer homology, is rectangle-decomposable. This allows for the definition of a barcode consisting solely of rectangles in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ associated with $\\mathbb{HF}_{\\ast}^{(\\bullet,\\bullet]}$. We observe that this rectangle barcode contains information about Usher's boundary depth and spectral invariants developed by Oh, Schwarz, and Viterbo. Moreover, we introduce a novel invariant extracted from $\\mathcal{B}_{\\ast}^{(\\bullet,\\bullet]}$, which proves instrumental in detecting periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we establish relevant stability results, particularly concerning the bottleneck distance and Hofer's distance."
