abstract = "Banyaga and Hurtubise defined the Morse--Bott--Smale chain complex as a quotient of a large chain complex by introducing five degeneracy relations. In this paper, we unify the five conditions into only one degeneracy condition. This allows for a simpler definition of Morse--Bott homology and more computable examples. Moreover, we show that our chain complex for a Morse--Smale function is quasi-isomorphic to the Morse--Smale--Witten chain complex. As a result, we obtain another proof of the Morse Homology Theorem."
